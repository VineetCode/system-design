Problem:

Implement a simple rate limiter middleware for an API.

The rule: Allow a maximum of 5 requests per minute per IP address.

Requirements:

Track requests based on client IP.
If limit is exceeded, return a 429 (Too Many Requests) error.
Use in-memory storage (dictionary or object) for simplicity.


Requirements recap:
✅ Track per IP
✅ Allow max 5 requests per minute
✅ Return 429 if exceeded
✅ Use in-memory storage (Map)
